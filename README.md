Have you ever been waiting for a website to start working, something you directly depended on? 
If you start reading the news or go on business, there is a risk of missing when the website 
starts working and losing a lot of useful time. I give you a solution that will notify you 
through your computer speakers if the website starts working. Just try how this script works.

```bash
./beefifping.sh 192.168.1.46
